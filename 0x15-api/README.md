In this project, we will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so letâ€™s build Python scripts.

Tasks:

## 0. Gather data from an API
Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

## 1. Export to CSV
extend your Python script to export data in the CSV format.

## 2. Export to JSON
extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

## 3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries
extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.
